Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are usually used for image classification. CNN is a regular Neural Network (NN) with added layers before it.
Those layers are introduced to reduce the number of parameters of regular NN
and to reduce overfitting. The goal is to classify pictures of cats and dogs and
in this project, we will see different models, starting from the simplest one and
moving to the more complex models, with aim to reach high accuracy and low
loss. After choosing the best model according to the accuracy and log loss,
the modelâ€™s hyperparameters are tuned, and then the model is validated using
5-Fold cross-validation. The final model is evaluated on the testing set, and
also on 20 self-made pictures of cats and dogs.
